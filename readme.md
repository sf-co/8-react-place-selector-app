# PlacePicker – Personal Travel Wishlist & Tracker

```
PlacePicker is a React-based application that enables users to build and manage a personalized list of places they want to visit or have already visited. The app focuses on a smooth user experience with instant UI updates, confirmation dialogs for deletions, and clear error feedback to handle failed actions gracefully.

The project is built with modern React patterns, reusable components, and custom data-handling logic for fetching and updating places. It demonstrates asynchronous communication with a backend, structured state management, and clean separation between UI, logic, and networking, resulting in a scalable and maintainable frontend application.
